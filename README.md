# Real Estate Lead Conversion Landing Page

This is my first official portfolio project. 
The goal of this project is to show my coding ability combined with my experience as a digital marketer.

I believe that these two skill sets combined makes for a highly valuable frontend developer for any company. 
You can see my thought process through the code and the design of the the page clearly on how I think of the the target audience to generate leads.
